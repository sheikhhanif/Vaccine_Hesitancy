## Vaccine Hesitancy Detection Using BERT for Multiple Social Media Platforms
The study collected 193,023 labeled vaccine hesitant posts from three so-cial media platforms: Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. The results show that the BERT model outperformed the SVM and LR models, achieving an F1-score of 0.93, while both SVM and LR achieved F1-scores of 0.90 when de-tecting vaccine hesitancy across multiple social media platforms. The re-search also revealed that models trained with multi-platform data performed at least 15% better when tested with multi-platform data compared to mod-els trained with platform-specific data.
